# Improved AI-based Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

[TODO]: This repository will contain the code implementation, the neural network itself, and some further information on how to set up and run the AI-based controller for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).

[TODO]: Some short description of this repository / link to published paper / aXiv version

## Setup (tested under Ubuntu 20.04)

### Install the [LSTS Neptus Command & Control Interface](https://github.com/LSTS/neptus)

1. Clone the public, open-source repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/LSTS/neptus.git
```

2. Enter the cloned repository and run the `gradlew` build script:
```
cd neputs && ./gredlew
```

### Install the [LSTS DUNE Unified Navigation Environment](https://github.com/LSTS/dune)

1. Clone the public, open-source repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/LSTS/dune.git
```

2. Enter the cloned repository and run the `cmake` build script:
```
cd dune && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4
```
