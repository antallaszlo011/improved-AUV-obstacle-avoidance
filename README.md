# Improved AI-based Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

[TODO]: This repository will contain the code implementation, the neural network itself, and some further information on how to set up and run the AI-based controller for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).

[TODO]: Some short description of this repository / link to published paper / aXiv version

## Setup (tested under Ubuntu 20.04)

### Installing the [LSTS Neptus Command & Control Interface](https://github.com/LSTS/neptus)





- system requirements / system info already tested
- LSTS DUNE
- LSTS Neptus
- Instructions on how to run a simulated mission
- ONNX file of the NN controller
- Training scripts
- Running simulated missions with the NN controller
- Share info on verification of the controller / properties / available tools
